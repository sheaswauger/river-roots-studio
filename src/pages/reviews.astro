    text: `I did not consider myself the 'type' of person who would attend an expressive arts class but I am so grateful that I did. I was worried that I would be unable to connect or enjoy myself as I'm not 'artsy.' The class was nothing like what I had anticipated. My experience was cathartic. I was at first surprised at the emotions I was experiencing so openly in a room with others but they just flowed. I consider myself a spiritual person already and yet I felt as if this course guided me to tap into this new undiscovered outlet where I felt spiritually connected and embraced. I left feeling whole and at peace with myself. I couldn't recommend this experience with more enthusiasm and genuine goodwill to others.`,

    text: `Over the years I have participated in a number of self-help seminars, "insight" programs, and courses that promise much, but sadly deliver little. I was interested and willing to take the time, but, if honest, a little skeptical of an "Expressive Arts Class". The time I spent with Donna doing her workshop was absolutely amazing. By the time we had finished, working through a series of fairly simple creative exercises, I found myself in wonder at the insights that came forth. At the end of the session, tears in my eyes, sitting a little dumbfounded: the deep truths and wisdom that came up were surprising, disarming, genuine, and specific to my life and experience. For me, this course reminded me who and what I was created to be. Very powerful. Very inspiring. To this day, I have the course artwork on the wall in my office as a reminder of who I really am. Donna's course is not just for women, but anyone who is willing to explore the deeper truths and inspiration that can be found in their unique walk through life. This was good. This was time well spent. I wholeheartedly recommend this course.`,

    text: `As a long-time journaler, the art journaling exercise sounded right up my alley. I enjoyed following Donna's writing prompts and looking through the images she provided. During the last part of the exercise, when we were to 'listen' to what the images were saying to us, I was absolutely floored by what I 'heard' myself saying. This exercise allowed me to be quiet enough to listen to myself and hear what I was unwilling to pay attention to in my daily busyness. Donna created such a welcoming environment and led the workshop with a calm and assuring demeanor that allowed me to feel comfortable and at ease.`,

    text: `My workshop with Donna was gentle and profound. I already have a robust practice of a contemplative lifestyle and I am a professional artist, so I didn't know if the workshop would really be helpful. It was SO helpful. Donna's approach takes every person where they are and simply leads them deeper. It meets professionals and novices alike and guides them step by step into a space of listening. In that space, one can find exactly what they need — and often what they didn't know to look for: unhurried desires, profound self-compassion, open-ended questions, and even a little play. Donna's structure is methodical without being rigid. It lets the participant know they are in good hands, with an experienced, gentle guide who has, herself, done the beautiful and courageous work of deep listening.`,

    text: `Being in a time of major life transitions is exciting, scary, overwhelming, and fluid. Taking two hours to go through the Expressive Arts Workshop with Donna was a welcomed experience. It was non-threatening, fun, and a great way to pause in the middle of so much change to really listen to myself and be reminded of my journey in life to this point, and find renewed confidence for what's ahead. I didn't know that would be my take-home message, but I believe the truth is in each of us and sometimes you need to take the time to listen. Donna doesn't tell you what or how to think, but she facilitates an atmosphere through expressive art to help you find new and creative ways to help you process your tangled thoughts or your heart's desires.`,
